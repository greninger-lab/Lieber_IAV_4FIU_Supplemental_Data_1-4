# Lieber_IAV_4FIU_Supplemental_Data_1-4
Supplemental Data 1-4 for: Influenza A virus resistance to 4â€™-fluorouridine coincides with viral attenuation in vitro and in vivo


Each supplemental data folder contains the following **sub-folders**, tagged with the associated figure (attenuation, fitness, mouse, or ferret):
1. **rava_plots**, which contains .html files generated using RAVA (see https://github.com/greninger-lab/lava/tree/Rava_Slippage-Patch)
3. **R-scripts**, which contains two scripts (one for parsing the "final" csv table from RAVA output, and one for creating a figure)
4. **final_tables_by_lineage**, which contains the "final" csv tables from RAVA output that were used to generate the figures.

The supplemental data folder also contains two Excel files: **Supplemental_Data_BioSamples_per_figure.xlsx** and **Supplemental_Data_BioSamples_WT-controls.xlsx.**
The excel files have the following columns:
1. **BioSample Accession** (SAMNXXXXXXXX)
2. **BioSample Name**
3. **Figure** (1D, 2F, 4E, 5H, Supp1, Supp2, Supp3, Supp4)
4. **Figure Tag** (Adaptation, Fitness, Mouse-attenuation, or Ferret-transmission)
